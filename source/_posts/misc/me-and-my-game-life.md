Playing games is part of my life. Actually, these games are usually referred to as video games.

These days, I had finished a video game, called "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", which is known as one of the most famous RPG games in the world.

I love video games, but conversely I have never pay much time in playing games. Witcher 3 is the first which makes me pay so much time. -- It took me almost 3 months to finish it.

The story began in July of this year.

This summer is the first which forbid the extra-class of middle school students in these over ten years. My parents are all middle school teachers, so they fortunately have this exceptional complete summer vacation. To make more usage of this vacation, they want to go to Beijing and spend dozens of days in my home.

July is just the opening of the Tokyo Olympic Games. In order to give them a better home, my wife and I decide to buy a TV, so that my parents can spend their time on the Olympic live streaming or other TV Programs.

But when I paid the order for the inspiring 4K TV, my parents told me that they won't go to Beijing this Summer because the COVID-19 had been sprouting in Beijing again.

But the TV should not and could not be returned, so it normally becomes part of our daily entertainment.

Playing games on the sofa is one of my ultimate dreams, so I began to find a TV game console to fit my TV. Finally, I bought an Xbox One X in the used market.

After configuring the Xbox with the TV,  I bought some games immediately, including "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", "NBA 2K21", "Dirt Rally 2.0", "Titianfall 2", "Battlefild 5" and "Battlefild 1", all these games are perfectly fit my Xbox because they can be played with 4K resolution and stablely 60 FPS.

In these 3 months, I spent a lot time in playing "Battlefild 5" and "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt".

"Battlefild 5" is a nice game because it has a perfect graphics. But I just finished and deleted it after a few days because it's mainline story is so short, and it's few difficult for me to play FPS game with other people in wireless controller.

But it become more different in "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", because it's a action role playing game. I feel very comfortable in playing this game in wireless controller, and I think wireless controller is the best way to play action game.

"Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" is the best fantastic game I have ever dream of. In this game, I can ride in the boundless grassland or snowfield, fight with the monster with magic and sword and crossbow, or just stroll through the stone floors of the medieval style city.

After playing it, I think "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" is a veritable "AAA" game. Which "AAA" means "A lot of time, A lot of resources and A lot of money". Apparently, "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" takes lot from me.

Some people would ask me would I be regret for wasting time in playing these game in such a hyper-competitive society. I would say I am very thankful to the Xbox and it's games, for it give me what I wanted, I feel satisfied in playing Xbox, I feel pleasant in playing video games, games is part of my life.
