Playing games is part of my life. Actually, these games are usually referred to as video games.

These days, I had finished a video game, called "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", which is known as one of the most famous RPG games in the world.

I love video games, but conversely, I have never pay much time in playing games. 

In the past time, I played classic video games such as Contra and Ninja Gaiden; played old-style computer games such as Counter-Strike, Age of Empires, GTA, Warcraft; played old-style online games such as Xyq, DNF, RO, DotA; played GBA games such as Castlevania, Pok√©mon, Fire Emblem; played PSP games such as God of War, Dynasty Warriors.

Games bring me a lot of hope, happiness, and imagination, but they take me lots of time too. I used to fall in love with a game and then take it away after a few days because I have to take care of my study.

With the rise and fall of games, I almost grew up to be an adult. I don't need to worry about my study anymore. Instead, I have to face my thorny work and career. When I finished my work and returned home, games cannot interest me because I am so tired. So even though there is no more homework to do, I still don't have much time to play games, especially the games that cost a lot of energy such as Dota2 and PUBG.

Recently, I mostly play games on my mobile phone, because it's too expensive for me to build a satisfying gaming environment on PC.

"Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" is the first which makes me pay so much time after graduating from university. It took me almost 3 months to finish it.

The story began in July of this year.

This summer is the first which forbid the extra-class of middle school students in these over ten years. My parents are all middle school teachers, so they fortunately have this exceptional complete summer vacation. To make more usage of this vacation, they want to go to Beijing and spend dozens of days in my home.

July is just the opening of the Tokyo Olympic Games. In order to give them a better home, my wife and I decide to buy a TV, so that my parents can spend their time on the Olympic live streaming or other TV Programs.

But when I paid the order for the inspiring 4K TV, my parents told me that they won't go to Beijing this Summer because the COVID-19 had been sprouting in Beijing again.

But the TV should not and could not be returned, so it normally becomes part of our daily entertainment.

Playing games on the sofa is one of my ultimate dreams, so I began to find a TV game console to fit my TV. Finally, I bought an Xbox One X in the used market.

After configuring the Xbox with the TV,  I bought some games immediately, including "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", "NBA 2K21", "Dirt Rally 2.0", "Titianfall 2", "Battlefield 5" and "Battlefield 1", all these games are perfectly fit my Xbox because they can be played with 4K resolution and solid 60 FPS.

In these 3 months, I spent a lot of time playing "Battlefield 5" and "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt".

"Battlefield 5" is a nice game because it has perfect graphics. But I just finished and deleted it after a few days because its mainline story is so short, and it's difficult for me to play an FPS game with other people in the wireless controller.

But it becomes more different in "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" because it's an action role-playing game. I feel very comfortable playing this game in the wireless controller, and I think a wireless controller is the best way to play an action game.

Honestly, "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" may not have much innovation, but it is still the best fantastic game I have ever dream of. In this game, I can ride in the boundless grassland or snowfield, fight with the monster with magic and sword and crossbow, or just stroll through the stone floors of the medieval-style city.

After playing it, I think "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" is a veritable "AAA" game. Which "AAA" means games that cost "A lot of time, A lot of resources and A lot of money" to develop. Apparently, "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" takes a lot from me.

Some people would ask me would I be regret wasting time playing these games in such a hyper-competitive society. I would say I am very thankful to the Xbox and its games, for it give me what I wanted, I feel satisfied in playing Xbox, I feel pleasure in playing video games, games are part of my life.
